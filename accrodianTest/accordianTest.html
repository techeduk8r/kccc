					<p>Cats are cats. You can buy them a fancy new bed or toy and all they want is the box. So, put that box to work for you. DIY food puzzles are an easy and inexpensive way to introduce your cat to foraging or provide enrichment. A small box with crinkled paper and food or treats is a great place to start. Another simple tool is a toilet paper tube with a hole or two that is just big enough for the contents to fall through and both ends pushed in. Your cat can roll the tube around to get the food to fall out. It’s great entertainment for you and your cat!</p>

					<p>The website <a href="foodpuzzlesforcats.com"> foodpuzzlesforcats.com </a> offers videos, reviews, and DIY instructions for a variety of food puzzles. Take a look and try one out today.</p>

					<span>Food Foraging</span>
					<div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></div>
				</label>
				<div class="content">
					<p>A wild cat spends much of its day hunting or foraging for food. This physical and mental activity keeps them stimulated. For a house cat, the use of food foraging can provide physical and mental stimulation as well as an outlet for extra energy. </p>

					<p>Food foraging can be achieved by placing the cat’s regular dry or wet food in food puzzles, snuffle mats, or other dispensers throughout the house. This method of enrichment takes time for your cat to learn but can be very rewarding and stave off unwanted behaviors. The resources below provide more information about food foraging. </p>

					<p>Interactive cat toys are toys that will respond to your cat’s interaction with them, such as a weighted wobble toy with a feather wand attached or electronic toys that create some type of realistic ‘prey’ movement like a Peek a Bird or a HexBug. These toys can provide independent play and fulfill a cat’s natural desire to stalk and hunt. </p>

					<p>Interactive toys can be found online through pet supply companies and other online retailers. </p>

					<span>Structured Play</span>
					<div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></div>

				<div class="content">
					<p>Cats have the natural instinct to hunt, catch, kill, and eat. This behavior, left unchecked, can result in undesired behaviors such as scratching furniture, knocking items off tables, or stalking and pouncing on you! Although the last one may seem cute in a kitten, it can become dangerous as a cat grows and becomes stronger. To help all cats, but especially very active cats, get out this pent up hunting energy, you need to engage them in structured play. </p>

					<p>So, what is structured play? Basically, it is play that takes a cat through the hunt, catch, kill cycle until they are satisfied. This type of play can be followed up with a meal, resulting in grooming and nap time! Planning a structured play session and meal right before bed is a great way to help you get a bit more sleep! </p>

					<p>Jackson Galaxy provides a good overview of what structured play looks like in his video ‘Fix Playtime With Your Cat!.’</p>

					<span>Harness Training</span>
					<div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></div>
				</label>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Interactive toys and structured play go a long way for most cats, but there will still be some cats that need even more enrichment. This might be an extremely active and curious cat or a cat that was formerly an outside cat. This is where harness training can play a role. Harness training provides a controlled environment for a cat to explore an outdoor area. This outdoor exploration provides a variety of sights, sounds, smells, and surfaces that will stimulate your cat. Through harness training and regularly scheduled ‘walks’ (we all know you can’t walk a cat) your cat can get the stimulation needed to be happy and healthy. </p>

					<p>Harness training takes time and not all cats will be open to the idea. Jackson Galaxy provides tips and a process for introducing a harness and walks. If you think your cat might be interested in an outdoor adventure, take a look at the Should You Leash Walk Your Cat? | Ask the Cat Daddy article and watch the video.</p>
